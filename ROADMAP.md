## üì¶ Phase 4 ‚Äî DevOps & Production Ready (Status: Upcoming)

**Planned:**

- [ ] GitHub Actions CI (PEST + future Vitest)
- [ ] Deployment pipeline (Forge / container)
- [ ] Privacy-friendly analytics (Umami / Plausible)
- [ ] Manual QA + accessibility audit

**Partially Done:**

- [x] Service layer started (InvitationService, DrawService, GroupService in progress)
- [x] README badges & install docs

---

## ‚úÖ Current Practices & Guidelines

- Controllers lean; heavy logic in services (continuing refactors)
- Validation currently inline in some controllers; migrating toward Form Requests
- Inertia responses only include needed fields (manual shaping)
- Tests required for new feature merges
- Prefer localization keys over hardcoded strings
- Avoid premature optimization; watch for N+1 in group show/draw flows

---

## üìò Notes

- SQLite used locally for fast iteration; MySQL planned for staging/prod
- Inertia + Vue approach avoids duplicating routing logic
- E2E (Playwright) will be evaluated after core features freeze

Let‚Äôs build something solid, fun, and developer-friendly.
