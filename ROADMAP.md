# üìç Secret Santa ‚Äî Roadmap

Welcome to the Secret Santa project's official development roadmap.  
This file outlines the major development phases, priorities, and best practices that guide the entire project lifecycle.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

A modern fullstack web app to manage Secret Santa groups with gift budgets, custom draw rules, user-friendly flows, and scalable backend logic.  
Built with Laravel 12, Inertia.js 2, Vue 3, Pinia, TypeScript, and ShadCN Vue.

> Goal: To deliver a clean, secure, and delightful experience for both organizers and participants.

## üß± Phase 1 ‚Äî Foundation & Auth (Status: Complete)

**Delivered:**

- [x] Laravel 12 + Inertia + Vue 3 base
- [x] Auth (login / register / reset / email verification)
- [x] Profile update (name/email/password) & password confirmation
- [x] Feature tests (auth flows)
- [x] Basic layout shell (iterating)

**Pending / Nice to Have:**

- [ ] Sidebar + richer nav structure
- [ ] Pinia stores (using direct Inertia props for now)
- [ ] Vitest unit tests for auth store (post store introduction)

---

## üéÅ Phase 2 ‚Äî Group & Draw Core (Status: Complete)

**Delivered:**

- [x] Group creation (name, description)
- [x] Participant list & counts
- [x] Join code generation & regeneration
- [x] Invitation lifecycle (create, resend, revoke, accept, decline, expire)
- [x] Invitation privacy & status landing (no 404 for invalid)
- [x] Draw service (single-run enforcement + assignments)
- [x] Recipient fetch + wishlist display
- [x] Participant management (remove with constraints, ownership transfer)
- [x] Join requests (approve / deny, code join)
- [x] Policies & access control additions
- [x] Extensive feature test coverage

**Delivered (Extended):**

- [x] Min draw/date-only scheduling (`draw_at` simplified to YYYY-MM-DD)
- [x] Draw restrictions (exclusions matrix + feasibility preview + sample mapping)
- [x] Encrypted assignment storage (versioned ciphers, rotation & verification commands)
- [x] Auto-draw scheduled command for due groups
- [x] Share links + attributed join requests
- [x] Min/max gift value fields (model, validation, service wiring + UI render)

**Pending / Planned:**

- [ ] Enhanced metrics (readiness %, wishlist coverage panel UI)
- [ ] Frontend Vitest coverage for critical flows

---

## üåê Phase 3 ‚Äî User Experience & Engagement (Status: In Progress)

**Delivered:**

- [ ] Public group landing + countdown

### Public Group Landing (Delivered)

- Minimal public landing page (`/g/{public_code}`) with name, description, participant count, draw countdown & CTAs
- Uses non-enumerable `public_code` (Base62 random 12 chars)
- 404 fallback page implemented (Inertia `Errors/NotFound`)
- No leakage of internal integer IDs on public surface

* [ ] Email notifications expansion (wishlist change reminders, inactivity nudges)
* [ ] Recipient enhancements (anonymized hint, gift guidelines, notes)
* [ ] Activity feed & group history timeline
* [ ] Metrics panel (expanded readiness / participation)

---

- [ ] GitHub Actions CI (PEST + Vitest + later Playwright)
- [ ] Containerized deploy (Docker/Forge or CI CD pipeline)

### Identifier Hardening (Delivered Phase 1)

- Unified 404 strategy via `EnsureGroupMembership` middleware (returns 404 for non-members)
- Added `public_code` to groups with backfill migration
- Public landing consumes only `public_code`
- Documentation: `docs/SECURITY_IDENTIFIERS.md`
- Future (planned): optional slugs + rotation (not started)

* [ ] Manual QA + accessibility audit (WCAG baseline)
* [ ] Health/metrics endpoint (readiness & liveness probes)

**Partially Done:**

- [x] Service layer started (InvitationService, DrawService, GroupService in progress)
- [x] README badges & install docs

---

## üîê Phase 5 ‚Äî Security & Data Lifecycle (Status: Planned)

**Scope:** Hardening encryption, lifecycle policies, abuse prevention.

**Planned:**

- [ ] Drop legacy nullable `receiver_user_id` column after stability window
- [ ] Scheduled automated cipher verification job
- [ ] Rate limiting / abuse protection on invitation & share link endpoints
- [ ] Data retention policy (e.g., optional purge X days post draw)
- [ ] Secret rotation playbook (APP_KEY & future data keys)
- [ ] Audit logging (sensitive admin / ownership changes)
- [ ] Explore per-group envelope encryption (future `v2` plan)

**Future Research:**

- KMS integration for master key wrapping
- Tamper alerts if cipher verification fails

## üìà Phase 6 ‚Äî Scalability & Advanced Features (Status: Backlog)

**Targets:** Performance resilience for larger groups, richer analytics, predictive tooling.

**Backlog Candidates:**

- [ ] Caching / precomputation for readiness metrics
- [ ] Load / stress tests for draw solver at scale
- [ ] Property-based fuzz tests for exclusion graphs
- [ ] Activity & audit event sourcing (append-only log)
- [ ] Graph visualization of exclusions
- [ ] Advanced engagement analytics (conversion, retention)
- [ ] Multi-locale expansion (additional languages beyond en / pt_BR)
- [ ] Envelope encryption proof-of-concept
- [ ] Scheduled rotation orchestration CLI wrapper

## ‚úÖ Current Practices & Guidelines

- Controllers lean; heavy logic in services (continuing refactors)
- Validation currently inline in some controllers; migrating toward Form Requests
- Inertia responses only include needed fields (manual shaping)
- Tests required for new feature merges
- Prefer localization keys over hardcoded strings
- Avoid premature optimization; watch for N+1 in group show/draw flows

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Documentation References

- Encryption & rotation: `docs/ENCRYPTION.md`
- Draw mechanics & exclusions: `docs/DRAW_MECHANICS.md`
- Share links & join requests: `docs/SHARE_LINKS.md`
- Invitation payload contract: `docs/INVITATION_PAYLOAD.md`
- Draw date rules: `docs/DRAW_DATE.md`

## üìò Notes

- SQLite used locally for fast iteration; MySQL planned for staging/prod
- Inertia + Vue approach avoids duplicating routing logic
- E2E (Playwright) will be evaluated after core features freeze

---

## üß∞ Backlog (Unsorted Quick Ideas)

- Skeleton loading & optimistic UI states
- Offline-friendly wishlist edits (queued sync)
- Admin dashboard for support / moderation
- Gamified achievements / badges
- Integration webhook for external gift registries
- Timeboxed ephemeral hints between participants

Let‚Äôs build something solid, fun, and developer-friendly.
