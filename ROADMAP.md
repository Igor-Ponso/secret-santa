## üì¶ Phase 4 ‚Äî DevOps & Production Ready

**Goals:** Optimize performance, enforce best practices, and prepare for release.

- [ ] Review queries (N+1, eager loading, indexing)
- [ ] Use Laravel model binding everywhere (no IDs in requests)
- [ ] Enforce clean service layer (`DrawService`, `GroupService`)
- [ ] Add PHPDocs on all methods
- [ ] Setup CI with GitHub Actions for PEST/Vitest on PR
- [ ] Deploy to Forge or Vercel
- [ ] Add analytics (privacy-friendly)

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Use Setup Stores and TypeScript on all Pinia state
- Keep controllers thin, move logic to services
- Validate with Form Requests
- Use Resources for API formatting
- Write PEST + Vitest tests for all new features
- Comments only when something is not obvious
- Prioritize performance ‚Äî paginate, eager load, index

---

## üìò Notes

- DB: MySQL is more than enough (only avatars will be stored)
- Frontend is fully Inertia + Vue 3 ‚Äî no need for SPA routing
- Consider Cypress or Playwright for final E2E flows (optional)

Let‚Äôs build something solid, fun, and developer-friendly.
